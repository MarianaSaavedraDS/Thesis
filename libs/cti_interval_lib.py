"""
CTI Interval Extraction Library.

@file: cti_interval_lib.py

@coding: utf_8

@description: This module contains functions for extracting and processing 
intervals from label sequences in cardiovascular signal data. These 
functions can be used in analyzing and comparing time intervals in ECG and 
PCG signal processing.

@functions:
- extract_label_events: Extracts the start and end times of specific labels 
  (e.g., S1, S2) from a sequence of labeled events. The function returns 
  a dictionary with the start and end times for each label.
  
- compute_intervals_using_start_times: Computes the intervals between the 
  start times of two specified labels (e.g., S1 and S2) across multiple 
  signal sequences.

- compute_intervals_using_end_times: Computes the intervals between the 
  end time of one label and the start time of another label for all signal 
  sequences.

- compute_intervals_using_midpoints: Computes intervals based on the midpoints 
  of two labels, offering an alternative way to analyze the event timing.

- filter_outliers: Filters out intervals that are considered too short or too 
  long based on defined minimum and maximum interval thresholds.

- compute_avg_intervals: Computes the average interval for each signal 
  after outlier removal.
