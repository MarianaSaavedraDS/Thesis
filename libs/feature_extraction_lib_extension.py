"""
ECG and PCG feature extraction library extension.

@file: feature_extraction_extension.py

@coding: utf_8

@description: This module extends the feature_extraction_lib with custom 
functions necessary for ECG and PCG signals, without modifying the original 
library. It includes additional signal processing and feature extraction 
functions specific to the project.

@functions:
- process_pcg_signals_from_pkl: Processes PCG signals from a pickle file, 
  performs Schmidt despiking, Butterworth filtering, and extracts various 
  features (homomorphic envelope, CWT, Hilbert envelope). The function 
  returns a DataFrame of extracted features for each signal.
  
@see: feature_extraction_lib.py for the original signal processing and 
      feature extraction functions.
